This repo contains the source code for my blog, Logic Memory Center. It is
accessible at blog.kiranshila.com

While certain things are tuned to my liking, the code base is quite simple to modify and
is "static enough" to run on GitHub Pages, as this is.

Feel free to fork and customize to your liking.
